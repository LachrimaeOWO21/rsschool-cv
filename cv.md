# About me

I am 20 years old and I am currently studying at university in my third year at the Faculty of Intercultural Communication. I also work as a sales assistant in a logistic company. I want to change my field of interest and start working as a Front-end developer. By the way, I have an experience when I tried to master this sphere, but due to quite a lot of information I couldn't cope with it. But now I found this course and I hope that with its help I will become a highly skilled Front-end developer. I will work hard to achieve this.
